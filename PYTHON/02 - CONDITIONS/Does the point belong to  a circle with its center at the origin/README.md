# The coordinates of the point and the radius of the circle, the center of which is at the origin, are entered. 
# Determine if a point belongs to a circle (is within it).

- It is neccessary to calculate the length of the segment from the origin to a given point.
- If this segment is not larger than the radius of the circle 
- then the point will belong to the circle.
- The segment is the hypotenus of a traingle. 
- The hypotenus is found Using the pythagorean theorem.
- If hypotenus is not greater than the radius, then the point belongs to a circle.
