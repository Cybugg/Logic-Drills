# Coefficient "a", "b" and "c" of the quadratic equation are entered. Determine if the given equation has roots. If so, calculate and display them.
- a * x * x + b * x + c = 0
- when the coefficients are known, we are dealing with a specific quadratic equation.
- The roots of the equation are the values of the variable x for which a particular equation becomes true.
- If the discriminant is less than zero, the equation has no roots.
